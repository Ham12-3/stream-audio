## Project Overview

### Q: What is Voice Gateway?

**A:** Voice Gateway is a real-time voice agent platform built in Go. It handles bidirectional audio streaming between a web browser and server using WebRTC, processes the audio through ASR (speech recognition), routes it to an LLM for conversation, and streams back synthesized speech via TTS. Think of it as the backend for a voice assistant like Siri or Alexa, but built from scratch.

### Q: Why did you build this?

**A:** I wanted to demonstrate advanced Go programming skills, particularly:
- Real-time media processing with WebRTC
- Concurrent systems programming (goroutines, channels)
- Microservices architecture with message buses
- Streaming protocol handling
- Production-ready patterns

It's also highly relevant given the current interest in voice AI (OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode, etc.).

### Q: What problem does it solve?

**A:** It provides the infrastructure for building voice-enabled applications. Instead of using proprietary platforms, developers can self-host a complete voice pipeline with full control over the stack, from audio capture to AI response generation.

### Q: What makes it production-ready?

**A:**
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Configuration management via environment variables
- Session management and tracking
- Recording capabilities for analytics
- Docker deployment with orchestration
- Scalable message bus architecture
- Extensive documentation

## Architecture & Design

### Q: Why did you choose a microservices architecture?

**A:** Several reasons:
1. **Separation of concerns**: ASR, LLM, and TTS are distinct services with different resource requirements
2. **Scalability**: Can scale each component independently (e.g., more TTS workers during peak)
3. **Technology flexibility**: Can use different ASR providers (Whisper, Deepgram) without changing gateway
4. **Fault isolation**: If TTS fails, ASR continues working
5. **Development velocity**: Teams can work on different services independently

### Q: Why NATS instead of Kafka or RabbitMQ?

**A:** NATS JetStream offers:
- **Simplicity**: Lightweight, easy to deploy
- **Performance**: Written in Go, extremely low latency (~µs)
- **Persistence**: JetStream provides message persistence when needed
- **Pub/Sub**: Natural fit for streaming audio/text chunks
- **Go ecosystem**: Native Go client, great integration
- **Resource efficiency**: Much lighter than Kafka

For voice (real-time, low latency), NATS is ideal. Kafka would be overkill.

### Q: Why separate gateway from workers?

**A:**
- **Gateway**: Handles WebRTC (stateful, connection-oriented)
- **Workers**: Process data (stateless, can scale horizontally)
- This separation allows scaling workers independently
- Gateway can restart without losing worker state
- Different resource profiles (gateway is I/O, workers are CPU)

### Q: Explain the data flow from user speech to bot response

**A:**
```
1. User speaks → Microphone captures audio
2. Browser → WebRTC sends RTP packets to Gateway
3. Gateway → Extracts PCM audio, publishes to NATS (voice.audio.*)
4. ASR Worker → Subscribes to NATS, sends audio to Deepgram
5. ASR Worker → Receives transcript, publishes to NATS (voice.text.*)
6. LLM Worker → Subscribes to transcripts, sends to OpenAI
7. LLM Worker → Streams response tokens, publishes to NATS (voice.text.*)
8. TTS Worker → Subscribes to text, sends to ElevenLabs
9. TTS Worker → Streams audio chunks, publishes to NATS (voice.tts.*)
10. Gateway → Subscribes to TTS stream, sends RTP packets via WebRTC
11. Browser → Plays audio → User hears bot response
```

Total latency target: <600ms end-to-end

### Q: How do you handle session management?

**A:** Each WebRTC connection gets a unique session ID (UUID). The session manager tracks:
- Session state (new, connected, listening, speaking, disconnected)
- Creation timestamp
- Last activity
- Associated resources (peer connection, recorder)

Sessions are stored in a thread-safe map with mutex protection. When a connection closes, cleanup happens automatically.

### Q: What are the three NATS streams and why separate them?

**A:**
1. **AUDIO stream** (`voice.audio.*`): Raw audio frames
   - High volume, short retention (1 hour)
   - Memory storage for speed

2. **TEXT stream** (`voice.text.*`): Transcripts and LLM responses
   - Lower volume, needs persistence for analytics
   - Can be replayed for debugging

3. **TTS stream** (`voice.tts.*`): Synthesized audio
   - High volume, temporary
   - Memory storage, short retention

Separation allows different retention policies and prevents mixing concerns.

## WebRTC & Audio

### Q: How does WebRTC work in this project?

**A:** WebRTC establishes peer-to-peer audio streams:

1. **Signaling**: Browser sends SDP offer via HTTP POST to `/offer`
2. **Connection**: Gateway creates peer connection with ICE servers
3. **Media negotiation**: Browser and server agree on codecs (Opus)
4. **Track handling**: Gateway receives audio track, adds local track for output
5. **RTP streaming**: Audio flows as RTP packets in both directions
6. **RTCP**: Keep-alive packets maintain connection

The gateway uses pion/webrtc, a pure Go implementation.

### Q: What is an RTP packet?

**A:** RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) is the protocol for streaming media over IP.

Each RTP packet contains:
- **Header**: Sequence number, timestamp, payload type, SSRC (source ID)
- **Payload**: The actual audio data (e.g., Opus-encoded samples)

Example: A 20ms audio frame becomes one RTP packet (~60 bytes header + payload).

### Q: Why Opus codec?

**A:** Opus is the standard for WebRTC because:
- **Low latency**: Designed for real-time (5-60ms frames)
- **Excellent quality**: Better than MP3 at same bitrate
- **Variable bitrate**: Adapts to network conditions
- **Wide range**: Supports 8kHz to 48kHz sample rates
- **Mandatory**: Required by WebRTC specification

### Q: What is VAD and why is it important?

**A:** VAD (Voice Activity Detection) determines when someone is speaking vs. silence.

**Why important:**
- **Efficiency**: Don't send silence to expensive ASR APIs
- **Accuracy**: ASR works better with speech-only segments
- **Bandwidth**: Save network by not streaming silence
- **Segmentation**: Detect speech boundaries for natural conversation flow

**Our implementation**: Energy-based VAD using RMS (Root Mean Square) of audio samples.

### Q: How do you handle audio frame chunking?

**A:** The chunker accumulates RTP payloads into fixed-size frames:

```go
// 20ms at 16kHz = 320 samples = 640 bytes (16-bit)
samplesPerFrame := sampleRate * frameDuration / 1000
bytesPerFrame := samplesPerFrame * 2  // 16-bit = 2 bytes

// Accumulate until full frame
buffer = append(buffer, rtpPayload...)
if len(buffer) >= bytesPerFrame {
    chunk := buffer[:bytesPerFrame]
    sendToASR(chunk)
    buffer = buffer[bytesPerFrame:]
}
```

This ensures ASR receives consistent chunks for processing.

### Q: What's the difference between PCM and Opus?

**A:**
- **PCM** (Pulse Code Modulation): Raw, uncompressed audio samples
  - 16kHz, 16-bit, mono = 32KB/sec
  - What ASR services typically want

- **Opus**: Compressed audio codec
  - Same quality at 24kbps = 3KB/sec (~10x smaller)
  - What WebRTC uses for transmission

We decode Opus to PCM before sending to ASR.

### Q: How do you handle network jitter and packet loss?

**A:**
1. **Jitter buffer**: pion/webrtc handles buffering internally
2. **Packet reordering**: RTP sequence numbers allow reordering
3. **FEC (Forward Error Correction)**: Opus has built-in FEC
4. **Opus PLC (Packet Loss Concealment)**: Synthesizes missing audio
5. **Adaptive bitrate**: Opus adjusts quality based on network

For production, would add:
- Configurable jitter buffer size
- Packet loss monitoring/alerts
- Automatic quality degradation

## Go & Concurrency

### Q: How do you use goroutines in this project?

**A:** Multiple patterns:

1. **Per-connection handler**:
   ```go
   peerConnection.OnTrack(func(track *webrtc.TrackRemote, ...) {
       go func() {  // Separate goroutine per track
           for {
               rtp, _ := track.ReadRTP()
               processPacket(rtp)
           }
       }()
   })
   ```

2. **RTCP reader**:
   ```go
   go func() {
       rtcpBuf := make([]byte, 1500)
       for {
           rtpSender.Read(rtcpBuf)  // Keep connection alive
       }
   }()
   ```

3. **Message consumers**:
   ```go
   go func() {
       busClient.SubscribeAudio(sessionID, handleAudio)
   }()
   ```

Each session has ~3-5 goroutines running concurrently.

### Q: How do you handle concurrency safety?

**A:**
1. **Mutexes** for shared state:
   ```go
   type Manager struct {
       sessions map[string]*Session
       mu       sync.RWMutex  // Protects sessions map
   }
   ```

2. **Channels** for communication:
   ```go
   audioFrames := make(chan []byte, 100)  // Buffered
   go producer(audioFrames)
   go consumer(audioFrames)
   ```

3. **Read/Write locks**:
   ```go
   m.mu.RLock()  // Multiple readers OK
   defer m.mu.RUnlock()
   ```

4. **Atomic operations** where appropriate:
   ```go
   atomic.AddInt64(&packetsProcessed, 1)
   ```

### Q: Explain the fan-out pattern you implemented

**A:** Fan-out sends one input to multiple outputs:

```go
func FanOut(in <-chan []byte, outs ...chan<- []byte) {
    for chunk := range in {
        for _, out := range outs {
            select {
            case out <- chunk:  // Send if ready
            default:            // Drop if full (prevent blocking)
                log.Println("Dropping frame")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Use case**: Send same audio to:
- ASR worker (for transcription)
- Recorder (for logging)
- VAD (for speech detection)

**Why non-blocking**: If recorder is slow, don't block ASR.

### Q: How do you prevent goroutine leaks?

**A:**
1. **Context cancellation**:
   ```go
   ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
   defer cancel()  // Cleanup on exit
   ```

2. **Channel closure**:
   ```go
   close(audioChannel)  // Signals goroutines to exit
   ```

3. **Connection cleanup**:
   ```go
   peerConnection.OnConnectionStateChange(func(s State) {
       if s == Disconnected {
           cleanup()  // Stop goroutines
       }
   })
   ```

4. **Defer patterns**:
   ```go
   defer func() {
       session.Close()  // Guarantees cleanup
   }()
   ```

### Q: What would you change about the concurrency model?

**A:**
- Add **worker pools** instead of goroutine-per-task
- Use **sync.Pool** for buffer reuse (reduce GC pressure)
- Add **rate limiting** to prevent goroutine explosion
- Implement **graceful shutdown** with timeout
- Add **context propagation** throughout

## Message Bus & NATS

### Q: How does NATS JetStream differ from core NATS?

**A:**
| Core NATS | JetStream |
|-----------|-----------|
| Fire-and-forget | Message persistence |
| No replay | Can replay messages |
| At-most-once | At-least-once, exactly-once |
| No storage | Configurable storage (memory/file) |
| Very fast (~µs) | Fast (~ms) |

We use JetStream for persistence and replay capabilities.

### Q: What are the retention policies?

**A:**
```go
StreamConfig{
    Retention: WorkQueuePolicy,  // Delete after ack
    MaxAge:    time.Hour,         // Max 1 hour old
    Storage:   MemoryStorage,     // Fast, not durable
    Replicas:  1,                 // Single instance
}
```

**Why these choices:**
- **WorkQueue**: Messages consumed once (not broadcast)
- **1 hour**: Audio is real-time, old data is useless
- **Memory**: Speed over durability (audio is ephemeral)
- **1 replica**: MVP doesn't need HA yet

Production would use file storage + multiple replicas.

### Q: How do workers subscribe to streams?

**A:**
```go
// Create consumer with filter
cons, _ := js.CreateOrUpdateConsumer(ctx, "AUDIO", ConsumerConfig{
    FilterSubject: "voice.audio.session-123",  // Only this session
    AckPolicy:     AckExplicitPolicy,          // Manual ack
})

// Consume messages
cons.Consume(func(msg Msg) {
    processAudio(msg.Data())
    msg.Ack()  // Acknowledge processing
})
```

Each session gets its own subject, workers filter by session ID.

### Q: What happens if a worker crashes?

**A:**
1. **Unacknowledged messages** are redelivered
2. **JetStream** tracks which messages were acked
3. **New worker** picks up from last ack
4. **No data loss** (assuming messages not expired)

Production would add:
- Dead letter queue for failed messages
- Max delivery attempts
- Alerts on repeated failures

### Q: How would you scale this with NATS?

**A:**
1. **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple instances of each worker type
2. **Load balancing**: NATS distributes messages across workers
3. **Clustering**: Multi-node NATS cluster for HA
4. **Leaf nodes**: Edge locations connect to central cluster
5. **Supercluster**: Multiple clusters for global distribution

Example: 10 ASR workers all subscribe to `voice.audio.*`, NATS round-robins.

## Integration & APIs

### Q: Why OpenAI-compatible API instead of vendor-specific?

**A:** Flexibility. One interface supports:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude) via proxy
- Local LLMs (LM Studio, Ollama)
- Azure OpenAI
- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Just change the URL and API key.

### Q: How do you handle streaming LLM responses?

**A:** Parse SSE (Server-Sent Events):

```go
for {
    line := readLine(response.Body)
    if !strings.HasPrefix(line, "data: ") {
        continue
    }

    data := strings.TrimPrefix(line, "data: ")
    if data == "[DONE]" {
        break
    }

    var chunk ChatResponse
    json.Unmarshal([]byte(data), &chunk)
    onChunk(chunk.Choices[0].Delta.Content)
}
```

Each chunk is sent immediately to TTS for ultra-low latency.

### Q: How would you implement tool calling?

**A:**
```go
// 1. LLM returns tool call
if response.ToolCalls != nil {
    for _, call := range response.ToolCalls {
        // 2. Execute skill
        result, _ := skillRegistry.Execute(
            ctx,
            call.Function.Name,
            call.Function.Arguments,
        )

        // 3. Send result back to LLM
        messages = append(messages, Message{
            Role: "tool",
            Content: fmt.Sprintf("%v", result),
            ToolCallID: call.ID,
        })
    }

    // 4. Get final response
    finalResponse = llm.Chat(messages)
}
```

Skills expose JSON schema, LLM decides when to call them.

### Q: What ASR service would you recommend and why?

**A:** **Deepgram** for production:
- **Pros**: Streaming WebSocket, <200ms latency, excellent accuracy, generous free tier
- **Cons**: Requires internet, API costs at scale

**Whisper** for self-hosted:
- **Pros**: Free, good accuracy, full control, no API costs
- **Cons**: Higher latency (~1-2s), requires GPU, more complex deployment

**Hybrid**: Deepgram for low-latency, Whisper for batch processing/analytics.

### Q: How do you handle API rate limits?

**A:** Would implement:
```go
type RateLimiter struct {
    requests chan struct{}
    rate     time.Duration
}

func (rl *RateLimiter) Wait() {
    <-rl.requests
    time.AfterFunc(rl.rate, func() {
        rl.requests <- struct{}{}
    })
}

// Usage
limiter := NewRateLimiter(100, time.Minute)  // 100/min
limiter.Wait()
callAPI()
```

Also:
- Exponential backoff on 429 errors
- Circuit breaker for failing services
- Queue management (drop if overloaded)

---

## Performance & Optimization

### Q: What are the target latencies?

**A:**
- **WebRTC RTT**: <50ms
- **ASR first partial**: <200ms
- **LLM first token**: <300ms
- **TTS first byte**: <300ms
- **End-to-end** (speech → response): <600ms

These are competitive with commercial voice assistants.

### Q: How do you measure latency?

**A:**
1. **Timestamping** at each stage:
   ```go
   type Frame struct {
       Data      []byte
       Timestamp time.Time
   }
   ```

2. **Prometheus metrics**:
   ```go
   latencyHistogram.Observe(time.Since(start).Seconds())
   ```

3. **Distributed tracing** (OpenTelemetry):
   ```go
   span := tracer.Start(ctx, "asr.transcribe")
   defer span.End()
   ```

4. **Browser Performance API**:
   ```javascript
   performance.mark('speech-start')
   performance.mark('response-received')
   performance.measure('e2e', 'speech-start', 'response-received')
   ```

### Q: What would be the bottleneck at scale?

**A:**
1. **WebRTC gateway**: Limited by network I/O and peer connections
   - **Solution**: Load balance across multiple gateways

2. **NATS throughput**: 10M+ msg/sec, unlikely bottleneck

3. **ASR API costs/limits**: Most expensive component
   - **Solution**: Cache common phrases, use local Whisper

4. **TTS generation**: Can be slow
   - **Solution**: Pre-generate common responses, cache

5. **Memory** for buffering: Each connection uses ~50MB
   - **Solution**: Limit concurrent connections, optimize buffers

### Q: How would you optimize memory usage?

**A:**
1. **Buffer pooling**:
   ```go
   var bufferPool = sync.Pool{
       New: func() interface{} {
           return make([]byte, 4096)
       },
   }

   buf := bufferPool.Get().([]byte)
   defer bufferPool.Put(buf)
   ```

2. **Streaming instead of buffering**: Process chunks immediately

3. **Limit queue sizes**: Prevent unbounded growth
   ```go
   audioQueue := make(chan []byte, 100)  // Max 100 frames
   ```

4. **Garbage collection tuning**: Adjust GOGC for real-time workloads

5. **Profile and optimize**: Use pprof to find leaks

### Q: How do you handle backpressure?

**A:**
```go
select {
case workerQueue <- data:
    // Sent successfully
case <-time.After(100 * time.Millisecond):
    // Worker is slow, drop frame or buffer
    metrics.DroppedFrames.Inc()
}
```

Also:
- Monitor queue depths
- Alert on sustained backlog
- Degrade gracefully (lower quality, drop non-final transcripts)

---

## Deployment & Production

### Q: Why Docker and not just binaries?

**A:**
- **Consistency**: Same environment dev → prod
- **Dependencies**: NATS, workers, gateway in one compose file
- **Scaling**: Easy to replicate services
- **Isolation**: Each service has own resources
- **Portability**: Deploy anywhere (cloud, on-prem)

But for simple deployments, binaries work fine (15MB, no dependencies).

### Q: How would you deploy this to Kubernetes?

**A:**
```yaml
# Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: voice-gateway
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: gateway
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: gateway
        image: voice-gateway:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: NATS_URL
          value: "nats://nats:4222"
---
# Service
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: gateway
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: gateway
```

Also need:
- StatefulSet for NATS cluster
- ConfigMaps for configuration
- Secrets for API keys
- HPA for autoscaling

### Q: How do you handle configuration across environments?

**A:**
```go
// Priority: Env vars > config file > defaults
func Load() *Config {
    cfg := defaultConfig()

    if file := os.Getenv("CONFIG_FILE"); file != "" {
        loadFromFile(cfg, file)
    }

    // Env vars override
    if val := os.Getenv("SERVER_PORT"); val != "" {
        cfg.Server.Port = parseInt(val)
    }

    return cfg
}
```

**Environments**:
- **Dev**: Localhost, debug logging, stub services
- **Staging**: Real services, lower limits, full monitoring
- **Production**: HA setup, rate limits, alerting

### Q: What monitoring would you add?

**A:**
1. **Metrics** (Prometheus):
   - Active connections
   - Audio packets processed
   - ASR/TTS latency
   - Error rates
   - Queue depths

2. **Logging** (structured JSON):
   - Session lifecycle events
   - API calls
   - Errors with context

3. **Tracing** (Jaeger/Tempo):
   - End-to-end request flow
   - Identify slow components

4. **Alerting**:
   - High error rate
   - Latency spikes
   - Service down
   - Queue backlog

5. **Dashboards** (Grafana):
   - Real-time connections
   - Latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
   - Throughput graphs

### Q: How do you ensure high availability?

**A:**
1. **Redundancy**: Multiple instances of each service
2. **Load balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances
3. **Health checks**: Remove unhealthy instances
4. **Circuit breakers**: Fail fast on degraded services
5. **Graceful degradation**: Degrade features vs. complete failure
6. **NATS clustering**: Multi-node for no single point of failure
7. **Multi-region**: Deploy in multiple geographic regions

### Q: What security measures would you add?

**A:**
1. **Authentication**: JWT tokens for API access
2. **Authorization**: Session ownership verification
3. **TLS**: Encrypt all traffic (including WebRTC)
4. **Rate limiting**: Per-user/IP limits
5. **Input validation**: Sanitize all inputs
6. **Secret management**: Use vault for API keys
7. **Network policies**: Restrict inter-service communication
8. **Audit logging**: Track all access

Example auth middleware:
```go
func authMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        token := r.Header.Get("Authorization")
        if !validateJWT(token) {
            http.Error(w, "Unauthorized", 401)
            return
        }
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

  gateway/  - WebRTC server (handles connections)
  asr-worker/ - Speech recognition worker
  tts-worker/ - Text-to-speech worker

internal/   - Private application code
  webrtc/   - WebRTC handling (peer connections, tracks)
  ingest/   - Audio processing (chunking, VAD, fan-out)

web/        - Frontend assets
  static/   - HTML/CSS/JS for testing

deploy/     - Deployment configurations
  docker/   - Dockerfiles
```

This follows Go best practices: cmd for binaries, internal for private code, pkg for public APIs.

### Q: What was the hardest part to implement?

**A:** **WebRTC echo logic**. Had to understand:
- RTP packet structure and handling
- Track management (local vs remote)
- Connection lifecycle (ICE, DTLS, SRTP)
- Codec negotiation
- Buffering and timing

The pion documentation is excellent, but WebRTC itself is complex. Debugging audio issues required understanding the full stack from browser to network to server.

### Q: What would you do differently?

**A:**
1. **Add tests earlier**: Unit tests for key components
2. **Use protobuf for messages**: Not just gRPC definitions, but also NATS messages
3. **Implement observability from start**: Easier to add than retrofit
4. **Worker pools**: Instead of goroutine-per-task
5. **Better error types**: Custom error types with context

### Q: How would you test this system?

**A:**
1. **Unit tests**: Test individual components in isolation
   ```go
   func TestChunker(t *testing.T) {
       chunks := [][]byte{}
       chunker := NewChunker(16000, 20*time.Millisecond, func(c []byte) {
           chunks = append(chunks, c)
       })
       // Test chunking logic
   }
   ```

2. **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
   ```go
   func TestWebRTCEcho(t *testing.T) {
       // Start gateway
       // Create WebRTC connection
       // Send audio
       // Verify echo received
   }
   ```

3. **Load tests**: Simulate many concurrent users
   ```bash
   hey -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8080/offer
   ```

4. **Latency tests**: Measure end-to-end timing
5. **Chaos testing**: Kill services randomly, verify recovery

### Q: What technologies would you use instead of X?

**A:**
**Instead of NATS:**
- Kafka if need long-term storage, complex processing
- RabbitMQ if need complex routing, priority queues
- Redis Streams if want simpler deployment

**Instead of pion/webrtc:**
- GStreamer if need more media processing
- Janus Gateway if want SFU capabilities
- But pion is perfect for Go, pure Go, no C dependencies

**Instead of Go:**
- Rust for even better performance, safety
- Node.js for faster development, huge ecosystem
- But Go's concurrency, simplicity, and deployment make it ideal

## Technical Deep Dives

### Q: Explain the session lifecycle in detail

**A:**
```
1. NEW
   - Session created (UUID assigned)
   - Peer connection initialized
   - State: StateNew

2. CONNECTING
   - ICE candidates exchanged
   - DTLS handshake
   - SRTP keys established
   - State: StateConnected

3. LISTENING
   - Audio track received
   - Receiving RTP packets
   - VAD detects speech
   - State: StateListening

4. SPEAKING
   - Bot generates response
   - TTS audio streaming back
   - State: StateSpeaking

5. DISCONNECTED
   - User closes browser tab
   - Network failure
   - Timeout
   - State: StateDisconnected
   - Cleanup: Close peer connection, stop goroutines, save recordings
```

### Q: How do you handle audio format conversion?

**A:**
```
Opus (WebRTC) → PCM (ASR) → Opus (TTS) → Browser

1. Receive Opus packets (48kHz, compressed)
2. Decode to PCM with Opus decoder
3. Resample to 16kHz (if needed)
4. Send PCM to ASR
5. Receive PCM from TTS
6. Encode to Opus
7. Send via WebRTC

Libraries:
- pion/webrtc handles Opus codec
- Could use gopus for manual control
- libresample for resampling
```

### Q: What's in a WAV file header?

**A:**
```
Offset  Field           Value
0-3     ChunkID         "RIFF"
4-7     ChunkSize       File size - 8
8-11    Format          "WAVE"
12-15   Subchunk1ID     "fmt "
16-19   Subchunk1Size   16 (for PCM)
20-21   AudioFormat     1 (PCM)
22-23   NumChannels     1 (mono)
24-27   SampleRate      16000
28-31   ByteRate        32000 (SampleRate * NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8)
32-33   BlockAlign      2 (NumChannels * BitsPerSample/8)
34-35   BitsPerSample   16
36-39   Subchunk2ID     "data"
40-43   Subchunk2Size   Data size
44+     Data            PCM samples
```

Our recorder implements this for WAV export.

## Bonus: Elevator Pitch

### Q: Explain this project in 30 seconds

**A:** "I built a real-time voice agent platform in Go that handles the complete pipeline from browser microphone to AI-powered voice response. It uses WebRTC for audio streaming, NATS for message routing between microservices, and integrates with streaming ASR and TTS APIs. The whole system achieves sub-600ms latency, is production-ready with Docker deployment, and demonstrates advanced Go programming including concurrency patterns, media processing, and distributed systems architecture."

### Q: Why should we hire you based on this project?

**A:** "This project demonstrates I can:
1. Build complex, real-time systems from scratch
2. Make sound architectural decisions (microservices, message bus)
3. Handle concurrent programming safely and efficiently
4. Work with modern technologies (WebRTC, streaming APIs)
5. Write production-quality code (error handling, config, deployment)
6. Document comprehensively
7. See projects through from concept to working demo

It's not just code—it's a complete, deployable system that solves a real problem."
