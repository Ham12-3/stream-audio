## 💡 Top 10 Interview Questions

### 1. What is Voice Gateway?
**A:** Real-time voice agent platform built in Go. Handles WebRTC audio streaming, processes speech through ASR/LLM/TTS pipeline, achieves sub-600ms latency.

### 2. Why microservices architecture?
**A:** Separate scaling, fault isolation, technology flexibility, development velocity. Gateway handles WebRTC, workers process data.

### 3. Why NATS over Kafka?
**A:** Lower latency (µs vs ms), simpler deployment, lighter resources, perfect for real-time audio streaming.

### 4. How does WebRTC work here?
**A:** Browser establishes peer connection via signaling (/offer endpoint), exchanges ICE candidates, streams RTP packets bidirectionally, Opus codec.

### 5. Explain the data flow
**A:** Speech → Browser → WebRTC → Gateway → NATS (audio stream) → ASR Worker → NATS (text stream) → LLM → TTS → NATS (tts stream) → Gateway → Browser

### 6. How do you handle concurrency?
**A:** Goroutines per connection, mutexes for shared state, channels for communication, context for cancellation. ~3-5 goroutines per session.

### 7. What's the fan-out pattern?
**A:** Send one audio input to multiple outputs (ASR, recorder, VAD) using channels with non-blocking select to prevent slow consumers from blocking fast ones.

### 8. What are the NATS streams?
**A:** AUDIO (raw frames), TEXT (transcripts/LLM), TTS (synthesized audio). Separate retention policies, memory storage, 1-hour max age.

### 9. How would you scale this?
**A:** Horizontal scaling of workers (NATS distributes), load balance gateways, NATS clustering for HA, caching, CDN for static assets.

### 10. What's next for this project?
**A:** Integrate Deepgram ASR, ElevenLabs TTS, complete LLM loop, add observability, deploy live demo, production hardening.

## 🎤 30-Second Elevator Pitch

*"I built a production-ready voice agent platform in Go that streams audio from browsers via WebRTC, processes speech through AI services, and responds with sub-600ms latency. It uses microservices architecture with NATS for message routing, demonstrates advanced Go concurrency patterns, and is fully deployable with Docker. The project showcases real-time systems programming, distributed architecture, and production engineering—all working together in 1,775 lines of clean, documented Go code."*
